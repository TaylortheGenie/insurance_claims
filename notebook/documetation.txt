This is for the insurance claim notebook predictions

Preprocessing was performed with no missing values and a few outliers were handled. 
Ordinal encoding was used throughout since the data set generally didn't have high cardinality amongst it's features

Due to the class imbalance for the target variable, random undersampling was preferred. 
However, selecting the best features using SelectKBest had little effect on the predictive. The performance increased by ~0.005.
Try to increase the predictive model's power more signinficantly. Probably using hyperparameter tuning or introducing a new classification predictive algorithm.
